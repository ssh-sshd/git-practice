i need to word hard
dont listen others
follow your goal only goal forget everything
dont hesitate no one care about you no one know about you situvation
no one understand you 
no one is there for you
no one is there to know about your feelings
no one is there to care you
no one is there to know about you and what is your situation
do hardword do more do more 
push it hard
push it 
dont give up
do what you do. do more 
push it untill you die
die for it
die for someting
not for anyone bez there is no one for you and no one cares you
dont think too much, just do hardwork 
do more and more just forget what others think
do more more push it what ever it takes
